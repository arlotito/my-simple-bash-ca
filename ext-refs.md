https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10175812/how-to-generate-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-using-openssl

As of 2021 with OpenSSL â‰¥ 1.1.1, the following command serves all your needs, including SAN:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes \
  -keyout example.key -out example.crt -subj "/CN=example.com" \
  -addext "subjectAltName=DNS:example.com,DNS:www.example.net,IP:10.0.0.1"
```
Other typical params of subject:
```bash
-subj "/C=US/ST=Oregon/L=Portland/O=Company Name/OU=Org/CN=www.example.com"
```


# Subject Alternate Name (SAN)
The commands below and the configuration file create a self-signed certificate (it also shows you how to create a signing request). They differ from other answers in one respect: the DNS names used for the self signed certificate are in the Subject Alternate Name (SAN), and not the Common Name (CN).

The DNS names are placed in the SAN through the configuration file with the line subjectAltName = @alternate_names (there's no way to do it through the command line). Then there's an alternate_names section in the configuration file (you should tune this to suit your taste):

```
[ alternate_names ]

DNS.1       = example.com
DNS.2       = www.example.com
DNS.3       = mail.example.com
DNS.4       = ftp.example.com

# Add these if you need them. But usually you don't want them or
#   need them in production. You may need them for development.
# DNS.5       = localhost
# DNS.6       = localhost.localdomain
# IP.1        = 127.0.0.1
# IP.2        = ::1
```

It's important to put DNS name in the SAN and not the CN, because both the IETF and the CA/Browser Forums specify the practice. They also specify that DNS names in the CN are deprecated (but not prohibited). If you put a DNS name in the CN, then it must be included in the SAN under the CA/B policies. So you can't avoid using the Subject Alternate Name.

If you don't do put DNS names in the SAN, then the certificate will fail to validate under a browser and other user agents which follow the CA/Browser Forum guidelines.


## Create a self signed certificate (notice the addition of -x509 option):
```bash
openssl req -config example-com.conf -new -x509 -sha256 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \
    -keyout example-com.key.pem -days 365 -out example-comh
```

## Create a signing request (notice the lack of -x509 option):
```bash
openssl req -config example-com.conf -new -sha256 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \
    -keyout example-com.key.pem -days 365 -out example-com.req.pem
```

## Print a self-signed certificate:
```bash
openssl x509 -in example-com.cert.pem -text -noout
```

## Print a signing request:
```bash
openssl req -in example-com.req.pem -text -noout
```
